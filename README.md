# adp-to-salesforce-example
This project was built to satisfy a specific use case for a demo but serves as an example of how an integration between ADP and Salesforce could work. ADP does not offer any sort of free trial/developer account, but I was able to find the specific output for an ADP API (https://developers.adp.com/articles/api/hcm-offrg-wfn/hcm-offrg-wfn-hr-worker-leaves-v2-worker-leaves/apiexplorer?operation=POST/events/hr/v1/worker.leave.absence.request) that would be sent upon a user requesting a leave - and used a Mock API to send that exact JSON object to simulate connection with ADP. This project takes the JSON object describing the leave, transforms it, and adds that to Salesforce as an Event object. The goal of this is to showcase that - any time someone requests a leave in ADP - it can automatically be sent to Salesforce and appear in the Salesforce shared Calendar for tracking by others.

This project requires creating a Mock REST API to receive the data. This is the site I use to create mock API endpoints: https://mockapi.io/projects
